                <h1>Michael Bruty</h1>
                <p>Hey there, I'm Michael - a highly-skilled developer with a strong focus on full-stack development.
                    React is my bread and butter, but I'm also well-versed in Vue and Angular. I am highly skilled in
                    building websites and APIs utilising Dotnet MVC and Blazor for my professional projects. However,
                    when it comes to my personal projects, I opt for Node or Spring as my go-to technologies.</p>
                <p>
                    I am proficient in SQL from my professional experience and have gained exposure to Redis, MongoDB,
                    and Neo4J through my studies.</p>
                <p>I have a strong dedication to creating websites that are user-friendly and accessible to all. My
                    ultimate goal is to make a positive impact on both people's lives and the environment.</p>

                <p>My dissertation focused on developing an online teaching platform that enhances existing platforms,
                    such as leetcode and hackerrank, intending to cater to higher-education institutions.</p>
                <p>I contributed significantly to developing a remote code execution engine that can scale using docker,
                    AWS, and Kubernetes. I conducted several usability studies to ensure that the interface was
                    user-friendly.</p>

                <p>I wrote a research paper proposing innovative approaches to visualise a dataset for the
                    Human-Computer-Interaction module. I performed in-depth research on the latest techniques for the
                    data type and merged them with my fresh visualisation ideas. I then crafted high-quality mockups and
                    ran a study to determine each visualisation's efficacy.</p>
                <p>This project showcases four representations of the open-reaction database. The first visualisation
                    offers a comprehensive dataset overview, enabling users to quickly determine its suitability. The
                    second visualisation filters reactions by a single element, displaying their connections on a
                    hyperbolic browser. Parallel coordinates are employed to compare a set of reactions with the same
                    product. Lastly, a modified reaction path analysis diagram is combined with a heatmap to compare a
                    small number of paths, providing insightful and nuanced analysis.</p>

                <p>This module involves building a website using JavaScript for the full stack, MongoDB for the
                    database, and web sockets for real-time communication. In my project, I developed a trial game where
                    a game master creates a series of trials that are either time-based or fastest to complete. Users
                    bid on competing in the trial, with the top-two bidders being selected to compete. Other users can
                    bet on who they believe will win the trial. The winners then play out the trial, with the winner
                    receiving all the beans. Upon joining the game, users can upload profile pictures, and distributed
                    users can participate through a video call using WebRTC.

                <p>I successfully developed a game using C++ and the OpenGL framework, which included a custom OBJ and
                    GLTF model loader. Unlike most underwater games that use unrealistic blur filters to create an
                    underwater effect, I utilized shaders to create more realistic lighting effects. By adding a
                    depth-of-field effect that blurs objects farther away from the camera and a lighting shader that
                    changes the colour of objects based on their distance from the player - red light only penetrates
                    5m, green 25m, and blue 35m. These effects created a more immersive experience. As a result of my
                    exceptional work, this project received a perfect score of 100%.

                <p>During my time at GOSS, I successfully collaborated with the creative design and CMS platform teams
                    to extract article data from the database and present it on a website that is mobile-friendly,
                    highly accessible and user-friendly. My primary responsibility was to create unique article
                    templates in a client-facing capacity. I guided clients through identifying their needs, handed off
                    the requirements to the design team for mockup creation, and completed the development process.</p>

                <p> During my work experience, I contributed to back-end projects. This involved developing and
                    troubleshooting workflows within a node.js microservice. These workflows occur after a form is
                    submitted, for example, automatically creating a new article about a local event after a council
                    member has approved it.</p>

                <p> While I was coming up to speed with the GOSS platform, my responsibility was to develop new features
                    for its framework. One of the noteworthy features I created was an upgraded tool for SEO. This
                    involved generating JSON-LD objects to enhance search rankings and enable web pages to use Google
                    rich results.
